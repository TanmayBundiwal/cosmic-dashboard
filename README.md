# Space Dashboard

## Overview 
The Space Dashboard is a web application that aggregates and displays real-time space-related data, utilizing various NASA APIs. This project serves as a practical application of Agile development methodologies and modern web technologies, reflecting my journey in evolving as a Solutions Engineer.

## Agile Development Approach
In line with Agile principles, the Space Dashboard is being developed iteratively. Each version is a result of focused sprints, ensuring a usable and valuable product at every stage. This approach not only aligns with efficient project management practices but also facilitates continuous integration of feedback and improvement.

## Version 1: React Foundation
The current version, built with React, is the initial step in this journey. It's a minimalistic yet functional starting point, embodying the core features:
- Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD): Displays NASA's daily space image along with its explanation.
- Near Earth Objects (NEO) Tracking: Lists and tracks asteroids and comets passing near Earth.
- Mars Rover Photos: Showcases the latest images from NASA's Mars rovers.
- Space Weather Events (DONKI): Provides updates on space weather events.

## Future Roadmap
The Space Dashboard is set to evolve with the following enhancements:
1. **Node.js Integration**: Transitioning into a full-stack application to enhance backend capabilities.
2. **Data Visualization with D3.js**: Implementing interactive visualization features, particularly for asteroid data.
3. **Deployment on AWS**: For scalability and robustness, the final version will be deployed on AWS, demonstrating cloud service integration skills.

## Project Setup
To get started with the Space Dashboard, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**: [Instructions here]
